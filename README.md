# ðŸŒ¸ ResNet50 Flower Classifier with Transfer Learning

A powerful image classification model built using **Transfer Learning with ResNet50**, trained on a 14-class **flower dataset**. This project leverages TensorFlow, Keras, and real-time performance visualization for production-ready flower recognition.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Uses **ResNet50** pretrained on ImageNet
- âœ… Supports **transfer learning** and fine-tuning
- âœ… Works with **custom datasets** (flowers in this case)
- âœ… Includes **real-time training plots**
- âœ… Predicts image classes with **confidence scores**
- âœ… Designed for **easy deployment or integration**
